[OpenSecurityTraining.info](http://OpenSecurityTraining.info) provides open materials for computer security-related training and classes. In order to support additional self-directed learning outside the classroom, we feel it is important to create engaging training games. To this end we collect here any training games and programs which can help reinforce lessons useful for becoming a better computer security professional.
