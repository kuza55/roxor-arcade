In order to run this example code, you must do the following:
cd xeno-mod-pefile-1.2.10-121
python setup.py install

Then you can play the game by typing
python BinHunt.py

NOTE: if you want to actually run the randomly generated
executables, you must have the Visual C++ 2010 (x86 or x64
depending on your system) redistributable libraries installed
x86: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555
x64: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632

.exe files can be just run normally
.dll files can be tested by doing:
rundll32.exe <C:\path\to\the.dll>,SayHello
And you should then see a message box saying hello

Enjoy!
